-- Create demo user account
-- Note: This creates a user in auth.users which requires service role permissions
-- In production, you'd typically create this through the Supabase dashboard or auth API

-- Insert demo user into auth.users (this requires service role access)
-- We'll handle this through the application instead since we can't directly insert into auth.users

-- Create demo moments data for the demo account
-- We'll use a known demo user ID that we'll create through the auth system
-- For now, let's create some sample data structure

-- First, let's create some sample prompt packs if they don't exist
INSERT INTO public.prompt_packs (name, description, icon, questions)
